# ðŸ›  Middleware in Web Development

## What is Middleware?

Middleware is software that sits **between the incoming request and the final route handler** in a web application. It acts as a pipeline to process, modify, or handle requests and responses.

Think of it as a **series of functions** that can:

* Inspect or modify requests before they reach your route handlers.
* Perform actions after a route handler generates a response.
* Handle errors or log requests.

## Common Use Cases

* **Authentication & Authorization** â€“ check if a user is logged in or has the required permissions.
* **Logging** â€“ record request details, response times, or errors.
* **Input Validation** â€“ verify that request data meets expected formats.
* **CORS Handling** â€“ control cross-origin resource sharing policies.
* **Compression & Caching** â€“ optimize response delivery.

## How Middleware Works

In frameworks like Express.js, middleware functions receive three arguments:

```javascript
function middleware(req, res, next) {
  // Do something with request or response
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
}
```

* `req` â€“ the incoming request object.
* `res` â€“ the response object.
* `next` â€“ a function that passes control to the next middleware.

Middleware functions are executed **in order** they are defined. This allows building a chain of operations. **Yes, you can use multiple middlewares** by stacking them, e.g.,

```javascript
app.use(authMiddleware);
app.use(loggingMiddleware);
app.use(routeHandler);
```

## Types of Middleware

1. **Application-level** â€“ applied to all routes in the app.
2. **Router-level** â€“ applied only to specific routes.
3. **Error-handling** â€“ takes four arguments `(err, req, res, next)` and handles errors.
4. **Built-in** â€“ included with frameworks (e.g., `express.json()`).
5. **Third-party** â€“ community packages for tasks like authentication, logging, or rate-limiting.

## Best Practices

* Keep middleware **focused** on a single responsibility.
* Order matters: place authentication before routes that require it.
* Handle errors gracefully and avoid exposing sensitive info.
* Reuse middleware wherever possible to reduce code duplication.

Middleware is a powerful pattern that enables **modular, maintainable, and reusable** code for handling requests in web applications.

### Placement Recommendation

> Middleware content is generally more relevant to **APIs**, because middleware is often used to handle requests on the server side.
It can also appear in the **frontend** if the framework supports client-side middleware (e.g., Next.js), but the main focus should be under APIs/server-side documentation.
