# NestJS Overview for Node Server Side Apps - APIs

**NestJS** is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It uses **TypeScript** by default and is heavily inspired by Angularâ€™s architecture, making it ideal for teams familiar with Angular.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

* Built on **Express** (default) or **Fastify** for high-performance APIs.
* Supports **REST**, **GraphQL**, **WebSockets**, and **microservices**.
* Uses **decorators**, **modules**, **controllers**, and **providers** for structure.
* Integrated **dependency injection (DI)** and **middleware** support.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Uses

* Backend for **Angular, React, or Vue SPAs**.
* **Microservices architecture** with message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka.
* **GraphQL APIs** for flexible queries.
* **Authentication/Authorization endpoints** (JWT, OAuth2).
* **Server-side rendering (SSR)** with Angular Universal.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Architectural Patterns

* **Dependency Injection (DI)**

  * Core to NestJS; allows modular and testable code.
* **Module-Based Architecture**

  * Organizes features and dependencies into separate modules.
* **Controller-Service-Repository Pattern**

  * Controllers handle HTTP requests; services contain business logic; repositories handle database access.
* **Factory Providers**

  * Create objects dynamically and manage complex dependency initialization.
* **Middleware & Interceptors**

  * Middleware: pre-processing requests.
  * Interceptors: modify responses or handle cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching).

## ðŸ”¹ Resolvers in NestJS

Resolvers are a key part of building **GraphQL APIs** with NestJS. They act like **controllers** in REST â€” mapping incoming GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions to the appropriate service logic.

### âœ¨ How They Work
* **Queries** â†’ Handle read operations (fetching data).
* **Mutations** â†’ Handle write operations (create, update, delete).
* **Subscriptions** â†’ Handle real-time data via WebSockets.

Resolvers use **decorators** such as:
* `@Resolver()` â†’ Defines a resolver for a specific GraphQL type.
* `@Query()` â†’ Maps to a GraphQL query.
* `@Mutation()` â†’ Maps to a GraphQL mutation.
* `@Subscription()` â†’ Maps to a GraphQL subscription.
* `@ResolveField()` â†’ Resolves relationships or computed fields.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure with Resolvers
When using GraphQL, the module folder typically looks like this:

/src
â””â”€â”€ modules
    â””â”€â”€ users
        â”œâ”€â”€ users.resolver.ts   # Handles GraphQL queries and mutations for users. It acts as the entry point for API requests, routing them to the appropriate service.
        â”œâ”€â”€ users.service.ts    # Contains the core business logic for user-related operations, such as creating, updating, and retrieving user data.
        â”œâ”€â”€ users.module.ts     # Defines the module, bundling the resolver, service, and other components together.
        â””â”€â”€ dto/
            â”œâ”€â”€ create-user.input.ts # A Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the data required to create a new user.
            â”œâ”€â”€ update-user.input.ts # A DTO for the data required to update an existing user.
            â””â”€â”€ user.output.ts       # A DTO that defines the structure of the data returned for a user.

### ðŸ”„ Code Flow with Resolvers

    A[["Client - GraphQL Playground or Apollo Client"]] --> B["Resolver (Query / Mutation)"]
    B --> C["Service Layer"]
    C --> D["Repository / ORM Layer"]
    D --> E["Database"]
```
* Client executes a GraphQL query or mutation.
* Resolver delegates logic to a **service**.
* Service calls repository/ORM for database access.
* Database result flows back through the resolver to the client.

---

### âœ… Why Use Resolvers?
* **Flexible queries**: Clients can request exactly what they need.
* **Strong typing**: Aligns with TypeScript and GraphQL schemas.
* **Separation of concerns**: Resolvers stay thin, delegating logic to services.
* **Real-time support**: Subscriptions allow live updates (e.g., chat apps, dashboards).


## ðŸ”¹ Best Practices for Folder Structure

```
/src
â”‚  main.ts
â”‚  app.module.ts
â”‚
â”œâ”€ modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€ users
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ users.controller.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ users.service.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ users.module.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€ dto
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€ create-user.dto.ts
â”‚   â””â”€ auth
â”‚       â”œâ”€ auth.controller.ts
â”‚       â”œâ”€ auth.service.ts
â”‚       â””â”€ auth.module.ts
â”‚
â”œâ”€ common
â”‚   â”œâ”€ filters
â”‚   â”œâ”€ interceptors
â”‚   â””â”€ guards
â”‚
â”œâ”€ database
â”‚   â””â”€ prisma.service.ts
â”‚
â””â”€ config
    â””â”€ configuration.ts
```

* **Modules** â†’ Encapsulate features.
* **Controllers** â†’ Handle HTTP routes.
* **Services** â†’ Business logic.
* **DTOs** â†’ Data transfer objects.
* **Common** â†’ Guards, filters, interceptors.
* **Database** â†’ ORM service (Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize).

## ðŸ”¹ Code Flow Diagram

```
[ Client (Angular) ]
        |
        v
[ Controller ]
        |
        v
[ Service Layer ]
        |
        v
[ Repository / ORM Layer ]
        |
        v
[ Database (PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB) ]
```

* Client sends HTTP requests.
* Controller validates requests and calls service.
* Service contains business logic and calls repository/ORM.
* Repository interacts with the database.
* Response returns back through the same path.
