# Observability

# Overview of Observability in Software Systems

**Observability** is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing its outputs. It goes beyond basic monitoring by helping teams ask **unknown-unknowns** â€” questions they didnâ€™t anticipate during development.

A well-observed system provides visibility into **logs, metrics, and traces**, enabling teams to detect, investigate, and resolve issues faster.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Observability Matters

* Quickly identify and troubleshoot production issues.
* Improve system reliability and availability.
* Understand user behavior and performance bottlenecks.
* Enable proactive monitoring and alerting.
* Reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR).

## ðŸ”¹ Core Pillars of Observability

1. **Logs**
   * Detailed event records of what happened.
   * Example: Errors, warnings, info messages.
   * Tools: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki, Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch.

2. **Metrics**
   * Numerical data collected over time.
   * Example: CPU usage, request latency, database query count.
   * Tools: Prometheus, Datadog, Azure Application Insights, AWS CloudWatch Metrics.

3. **Traces**
   * Follow requests across distributed systems (microservices).
   * Example: Tracking a userâ€™s API request across services.
   * Tools: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray.

## ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

* **Structured Logging**
  * Use JSON format for easy parsing.
  * Include context (userId, correlationId, requestId).

* **Distributed Tracing**
  * Propagate trace IDs across services.
  * Use OpenTelemetry SDKs to standardize tracing.

* **Dashboards & Alerts**
  * Set up dashboards for KPIs (latency, error rates).
  * Configure alerts for anomalies or SLA breaches.

* **Correlating Signals**
  * Link logs, metrics, and traces for root cause analysis.
  * Example: Slow API â†’ trace request â†’ find DB query in logs.

## ðŸ”¹ Observability in Different Stacks

* **.NET**
  * Use `ILogger`, Application Insights, Serilog.
* **Node.js / NestJS**
  * Use Winston, Pino, or OpenTelemetry SDK.
* **Databases**
  * Enable query logging and performance metrics.
* **Cloud Providers**
  * Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Operations Suite.

## ðŸ”¹ Code Flow with Observability

[ Client Request ]
|
v
[ API Gateway ]
|
v
[ Service A ] -- Logs, Metrics, Traces -->
|
v
[ Service B ] -- Logs, Metrics, Traces -->
|
v
[ Database ] -- Metrics, Query Logs -->


* Logs capture **what happened**.
* Metrics show **performance trends**.
* Traces connect **the full journey**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Ecosystem

* **Logging** â†’ ELK, Loki, Fluentd, Serilog, Winston.
* **Metrics** â†’ Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, Cloud-native monitors.
* **Tracing** â†’ OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin.
* **Full-stack APM** â†’ New Relic, Dynatrace, AppDynamics.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

Observability combines **logs, metrics, and traces** to provide deep insights into system behavior.  
Unlike traditional monitoring, which answers "is my system up?", observability answers **"why is it behaving this way?"**.  
A well-designed observability strategy is essential for modern, distributed, cloud-native applications.
