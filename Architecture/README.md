# Architecture Folder Overview
This folder focuses on application design and architectural patterns. Key topics include:

* **Dependency Injection (DI)**: A technique for managing dependencies between software components.
* **Factory Pattern**: A creational design pattern that allows for creating objects without needing to specify the exact class.
* **Repository Pattern**: An architectural pattern that abstracts data access logic and centralizes domain object interactions with the database.
* **Code Flow Diagrams**: Visual representations that show how requests are handled and how different parts of a system interact.
