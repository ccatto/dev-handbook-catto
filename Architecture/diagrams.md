# Architecture Diagrams

# Architecture Diagrams - Catto Developer Handbook

**Architecture diagrams** are visual representations of a system’s components, relationships, and workflows. They help developers, architects, and stakeholders **understand, communicate, and plan** software systems effectively.

## Why Architecture Diagrams are Important

- Provide a **high-level overview** of complex systems.  
- Aid in **decision-making** for technology, scalability, and security.  
- Facilitate **team communication** across development, operations, and management.  
- Serve as **documentation** for onboarding, maintenance, and audits.  
- Support **planning for microservices, cloud deployments, and integrations**.

## Common Types of Architecture Diagrams

1. **System Context Diagram**
   - Shows the **system as a whole** and its interaction with external entities (users, services, databases).  

2. **Container Diagram**
   - Depicts **containers/applications** within a system and how they communicate.  
   - Example: Web app, API, database, cache, messaging queues.  

3. **Component Diagram**
   - Shows **internal components** within each container and their dependencies.  
   - Example: Service layers, repositories, utilities, modules.  

4. **Deployment Diagram**
   - Displays **physical deployment** of containers, servers, VMs, cloud resources.  
   - Example: Kubernetes clusters, AWS EC2 instances, load balancers.  

5. **Flow / Sequence Diagrams**
   - Illustrates **dynamic behavior** or request/response flows between components.  

6. **Infrastructure / Cloud Architecture Diagrams**
   - Maps **cloud services, networks, storage, and security boundaries**.  
   - Example: AWS, Azure, GCP services for a web app.

## Best Practices for Creating Architecture Diagrams

1. **Start high-level** and progressively add detail.  
2. **Use consistent shapes and colors** for components, databases, and external systems.  
3. **Label connections** clearly to show communication, protocols, or data flow.  
4. **Indicate boundaries** (e.g., internal vs external, cloud vs on-prem).  
5. **Keep it simple** for stakeholders, but maintain **technical depth** for engineers.  
6. **Use standard notation** when possible (UML, C4 model, or cloud provider icons).  
7. **Update regularly** as the system evolves.
