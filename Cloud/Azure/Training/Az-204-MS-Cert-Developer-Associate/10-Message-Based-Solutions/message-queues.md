> 10.1.1 📦 Introduction to Azure Queues

Azure provides two types of queue mechanisms:  

- **Service Bus Queues** – Part of Azure’s messaging infrastructure, supporting queuing, pub/sub, and advanced integration patterns across multiple protocols, domains, or environments.  
- **Storage Queues** – Part of Azure Storage, designed for large-scale message storage (millions of messages) with global access via authenticated HTTP/HTTPS requests.  

Queues are commonly used for asynchronous work processing and workload backlogs.  

### ✅ After completing this module, you’ll be able to:
- Choose the appropriate queue mechanism for your solution.

> 10.1.2 📌 Choosing a Message Queue Solution

- **Service Bus Queues** → Best for advanced messaging scenarios like guaranteed FIFO delivery, duplicate detection, sessions for stream-like processing, transactions, larger message sizes, and role-based access.  
- **Storage Queues** → Best for very large-scale storage (80+ GB), tracking message processing progress across workers, and requiring server-side transaction logs.

> 10.1.3 🚀 Explore Azure Service Bus

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with **queues** and **topics** that decouple apps and services. Messages can carry JSON, XML, Avro, or plain text, enabling reliable, scalable communication.  

### 🔑 Use Cases
- **Messaging**: Transfer business data (orders, inventory, etc.).  
- **Decoupling**: Improve reliability; sender and receiver don’t need to be online simultaneously.  
- **Topics & subscriptions**: Enable 1-to-many messaging.  
- **Message sessions**: Ensure ordered or deferred workflows.  

### 💡 Service Bus Tiers
- **Premium**: High throughput, predictable performance, up to 100 MB messages, fixed pricing.  
- **Standard**: Variable throughput/latency, 256 KB message limit, pay-as-you-go.  

### ⚙️ Advanced Features
- **FIFO sessions**  
- **Autoforwarding** between queues/topics  
- **Dead-letter queue** for undeliverable messages  
- **Scheduled delivery & deferral**  
- **Transactions** for atomic operations  
- **Filtering & actions** for subscriptions  
- **Auto-delete on idle**  
- **Duplicate detection**  
- **Security**: SAS, RBAC, managed identities  
- **Geo-disaster recovery**  

### 🌐 Protocols & Clients
- Uses **AMQP 1.0** (ISO/IEC standard) + HTTP/REST.  
- Supports **JMS 2.0 API** (Premium).  
- SDKs for **.NET, Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript**.

> 10.1.4 Service Bus Queues, Topics, and Subscriptions

- **Queues**: FIFO, one-to-one messaging with load-leveling and loose coupling.  
- **Receive Modes**:  
  - *Receive and Delete*: Simple, may lose messages on failure.  
  - *Peek Lock*: Reliable, supports retries.  
- **Topics & Subscriptions**: One-to-many publish/subscribe model; subscribers receive copies of messages.  
- **Rules & Actions**: Filters and modifies messages to support custom routing and processing.


> Service Bus provides queues for FIFO, one-to-one messaging, and topics with subscriptions for one-to-many publish/subscribe communication, with support for filters, rules, and actions to route or modify messages. It offers two receive modes—Receive and Delete and Peek Lock—to balance simplicity with reliability in message processing.

---

> 10.1.5 Service Bus Message Payloads and Serialization

- **Message Structure**: Payload (binary block) + system-defined broker properties + user-defined properties.  
- **Routing & Correlation**: Uses properties like `ReplyTo`, `MessageId`, `CorrelationId`, and `SessionId` for request/reply, multicast, and multiplexing patterns.  
- **Serialization**: Payload stored as opaque binary; `ContentType` describes format (e.g., JSON). AMQP and .NET clients provide object serialization, though explicit serialization is recommended for compatibility.  

**Summary**: Service Bus messages carry binary payloads with metadata for routing, while serialization and content type ensure compatibility across clients.

10.1.7 ## Explore Azure Queue Storage ✅

Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages, accessible worldwide via authenticated HTTP/HTTPS calls.  
- Messages can be up to **64 KB** in size  
- A queue can hold **millions of messages** (limited by the storage account capacity)  
- Commonly used for **asynchronous processing backlogs**  

### Components
- **Storage Account** – entry point for all access to Azure Storage  
- **Queue** – contains sets of messages; names must be lowercase  
- **Message** – up to 64 KB; TTL defaults to 7 days, configurable beyond that in later versions  
- **URL Format** – `https://<storageaccount>.queue.core.windows.net/<queue>`  

### Summary
Azure Queue Storage provides a scalable, reliable way to queue messages for asynchronous, distributed workloads.

> 10.8 ## Create and Manage Azure Queue Storage with .NET ✅

This unit shows how to work with Azure Queue Storage using .NET and the **Azure.Storage.Queues** SDK.  

### Key Packages
- `Azure.Core` – shared primitives and abstractions  
- `Azure.Storage.Common` – shared infrastructure for storage libraries  
- `Azure.Storage.Queues` – main client library for Queue Storage  
- `System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager` – access configuration files  

### Common Operations
- **Create Queue Client** → `new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName)` ‼️ 
- **Create Queue** → `queueClient.CreateIfNotExists()`  
- **Insert Message** → `queueClient.SendMessage(message)`  
- **Peek Message** → `queueClient.PeekMessages()`  
- **Update Message** → `queueClient.UpdateMessage(messageId, popReceipt, "new content", timeout)`  
- **Dequeue Message** → `ReceiveMessages()` + `DeleteMessage()` (two-step to ensure reliability)  
- **Get Queue Length** → `queueClient.GetProperties().ApproximateMessagesCount` ‼️  
- **Delete Queue** → `queueClient.Delete()`  

### Summary
With the .NET SDK, developers can easily create, send, update, peek, and delete messages in Azure Queue Storage while ensuring reliability and scalability.

> 10.10 📋 Quiz: Azure Messaging  

1. **What is a key consideration when choosing to use Service Bus queues over Storage queues?**  
   - ✅ Your solution requires the queue to provide a guaranteed first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordered delivery.  
   - Your application must store over 80 gigabytes of messages in a queue.  
   - You require server side logs of all of the transactions executed against your queues.  

2. **What is the main difference between Service Bus queues and topics with subscriptions?**  
   - ✅ Queues allow processing of a message by a single consumer, while topics with subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication.  
   - Queues allow processing of a message by multiple consumers, while topics with subscriptions provide a one-to-one form of communication.  
   - Topics with subscriptions allow processing of a message by a single consumer, while queues provide a one-to-many form of communication.  

3. **What is the role of the `ContentType` property in Service Bus message payloads?**  
   - It encrypts the payload for secure transmission.  
   - It determines the size of the payload.  
   - ✅ It enables applications to describe the payload, with the suggested format for the property values being a MIME content-type description.  

4. **What is the purpose of the `QueueClient` class in Azure Queue Storage when using .NET?**  
   - It manages the configuration files for client applications.  
   - ✅ It retrieves and manipulates queues stored in Azure Queue Storage.  
   - It creates and manage messages within a specific queue.

## Question 18

You are developing a **Python image-rendering application** that leverages **GPU resources** and runs in an **Azure Container Instances (ACI) Linux container**.

The application requires a **secret value** to be securely provided **only at container startup**, and it must **only be accessible from within the container**.

**Goal:**  
Ensure that the secret is securely passed to the container at runtime.

---

### Options
- **Create an environment variable and set the secureValue property to the secret value** — *Correct*  
- Add the secret value to the container image and use a managed identity  
- Add the secret value directly to the application code and set the container startup command  
- Mount a secret volume containing the secret value in a secrets file — *Correct*  

---

### ✅ Correct Answers

**1. Create an environment variable and set `secureValue`**  
- Azure Container Instances allow you to define **environment variables at runtime**  
- Setting the secret as a **secure environment variable** ensures:  
  - The value is **not logged or exposed externally**  
  - Accessible **only inside the container**

**2. Mount a secret volume in a secrets file**  
- ACI supports **secret volumes**, which can be mounted into the container at runtime  
- The secret is stored in a **file inside the volume**, accessible only from the container  
- **Not baked into the image**, keeping it secure

---

### ❌ Explanation of Incorrect Answers

**Add the secret value to the container image and use a managed identity**  
- Baking secrets into the image is **insecure**; anyone with image access can extract it  
- Managed identities are for **resource access**, not secret injection

**Add the secret value directly to the application code and set the startup command**  
- Hardcoding secrets violates **security best practices**  
- Startup commands are **not a secure place** to manage secrets

**Add the secret to Azure Blob Storage and generate a SAS token**  
- SAS tokens themselves are **secrets** and still require a secure delivery method  
- Does not inherently solve the **secure injection** problem
