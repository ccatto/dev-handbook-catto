## Explore Application Insights  

> **Application Insights** (an extension of Azure Monitor) provides Application Performance Monitoring (APM) to track apps from development to production.  

### Key Features  
- **Live Metrics** – real-time monitoring without affecting hosts  
- **Availability Tests** – probe endpoints for uptime and responsiveness  
- **Usage Analytics** – track user interactions and feature adoption  
- **Smart Detection** – automatic anomaly/failure detection  
- **Application Map** – visualize app architecture and component health  
- **Distributed Tracing** – follow execution flow end-to-end  
- **DevOps Integration** – connect with GitHub or Azure DevOps  

### What It Monitors  
- Request/response rates, failures, and dependencies  
- Exceptions (server and browser)  
- Page views, AJAX calls, load performance  
- User/session counts  
- System metrics (CPU, memory, network)  
- Docker/Azure host diagnostics  
- Trace logs and custom events  

### Getting Started  
Telemetry is sent to Azure for analysis. You can:  
- Instrument at runtime (no code changes needed)  
- Add at development time for custom telemetry  
- Monitor client-side (web, AJAX, mobile)  
- Run availability tests from Azure servers

>  Discover log-based metrics  

**Application Insights** supports two metric types:  

- **Log-based metrics** – built from stored events via Kusto queries; highly detailed, great for analysis/diagnostics, but slower and may require sampling.  
- **Standard (preaggregated) metrics** – stored as time series with key dimensions; faster at query time, ideal for dashboards and near real-time alerting.  

### Key Points  
- Use **log-based metrics** for deep analysis and ad-hoc diagnostics.  
- Use **standard metrics** for performance, dashboards, and alerts.  
- Both coexist in Application Insights; newer SDKs support preaggregation by default.

> Instrument an app for monitoring  

**Instrumentation** = enabling an app to capture telemetry.  

### Methods  
- **Autoinstrumentation** – no code changes, quick setup, limited configurability, not in all languages.  
- **Manual instrumentation** – use SDKs or OpenTelemetry; allows custom events/metrics and full control.  

### Options  
- **Application Insights SDKs** – use when you need custom telemetry, control, or autoinstrumentation isn’t available.  
- **OpenTelemetry** – industry standard supported by Microsoft; unifies tracing/logging terminology.  

### Key Mapping (Insights → OpenTelemetry)  
- Autocollectors → Instrumentation libraries  
- Channel → Exporter  
- Codeless/Agent-based → Autoinstrumentation  
- Requests → Server Spans  
- Dependencies → Other Span Types  
- Operation ID → Trace ID  
- Parent ID → Span ID

> Select an availability test  

Availability tests in Application Insights let you monitor uptime and responsiveness of any public HTTP/HTTPS endpoint or REST API.  

### Test types  
- **Standard test** – Recommended. Checks endpoint availability, performance, TLS/SSL validity, HTTP verbs, custom headers/data.  
- **Custom TrackAvailability test** – Use SDK method `TrackAvailability()` for custom apps.  
- **URL ping test (classic)** – Legacy; being retired Sept 30, 2026.  

✅ Up to 100 tests per Application Insights resource.

> Troubleshoot app performance by using Application Map  

Application Map in Application Insights visualizes the **topology** of distributed apps, helping identify performance bottlenecks and failure hotspots.  

### Key points  
- Each node = app component or dependency with health KPIs and alerts.  
- Drill into diagnostics (App Insights events, Azure diagnostics like SQL Advisor).  
- Components = deployable parts of your app (with their own telemetry), distinct from external dependencies.  
- Supports multiple roles/resources; progressive discovery builds full topology.  
- Cloud role name identifies components (can be customized).  

✅ Use Application Map to quickly spot and troubleshoot issues across complex, multi-service applications.

> Exercise - Monitor an application with autoinstrumentation  
  
In this exercise, you create an Azure App Service web app with Application Insights enabled, configure autoinstrumentation without modifying code, deploy a Blazor application, and view application metrics and error data. This approach enables full monitoring and observability without code changes, simplifying deployments and migrations.  

### Tasks performed  
- Create a web app resource with Application Insights enabled  
- Configure instrumentation for the web app  
- Create a new Blazor app and deploy it  
- View application activity in Application Insights  
- Clean up resources
