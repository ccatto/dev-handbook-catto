# Udemy Practice Exam 5 

# Question 1

You are developing code that connects to an **Azure Cosmos DB** account.  
You want to know two different ways to connect using keys.

---

### ‚ùì Question
When working with code against Cosmos DB, what are two different ways to connect to the account using keys?

**(Select two answers.)**

- ‚úÖ **Use the Primary Key to authenticate and connect.**  
- ‚úÖ **Use the Secondary Key to authenticate and connect.**  
- ‚ùå Use a connection string that includes either the Primary Key or Secondary Key.  
- ‚ùå Use the Azure subscription ID directly to connect.  
- ‚ùå Use Azure Key Vault without any authentication to access the database.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answers

- **Use the Primary Key to authenticate and connect.**  
- **Use the Secondary Key to authenticate and connect.**

---

### üîç Explanation

- **Primary Key** ‚Üí Provides full read/write access to your Cosmos DB account and can be used directly to connect through the SDK or connection strings.  
- **Secondary Key** ‚Üí Works as a backup key, also providing full read/write access, and is useful for key rotation without downtime.  

**Other options:**  
- **Connection string with a key** ‚Üí Technically works, but still relies on Primary/Secondary keys under the hood; the question specifically asks about using keys directly.  
- **Azure subscription ID** ‚Üí Identifies the subscription, not used for database authentication.  
- **Azure Key Vault without authentication** ‚Üí You cannot bypass authentication when accessing Key Vault.  

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference
> **[Secure access to data in Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/secure-access-to-data)**

---

### üìù One-Sentence Summary
> You can connect to Azure Cosmos DB using either the **Primary Key** or the **Secondary Key**, both of which provide full access.

---

## Question 2

You are working with an Azure Table Storage application and want to migrate it to Azure Cosmos DB using the Table API.

You need to understand what the migration involves.

### ‚ùì Question:
What does it take to migrate a Table Storage application to a Cosmos DB Table API application?

- ‚ùå Rewrite the entire application using the SQL API SDK.  
- ‚ùå Rebuild the entire database and manually copy all data.  
- ‚úÖ **Change the connection string to point to the Cosmos DB Table API account and optionally migrate the data.**  
- ‚ùå Use Azure Migrate service to automatically recompile the application.

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Change the connection string to point to the Cosmos DB Table API account and optionally migrate the data.**

### üîç Explanation:
Azure Cosmos DB Table API is wire protocol compatible with Azure Table Storage.  
This means you can reuse the same SDKs, libraries, and application code with minimal changes.  

**Key steps:**
- Update the connection string to point to your Cosmos DB Table API account.  
- Optionally migrate existing data using tools like **AzCopy**, **Azure Data Migration Tool**, or custom scripts.  

**Why not the other options?**
- **SQL API SDK** ‚Üí Not needed; Table API is designed to mimic Table Storage.  
- **Manual rebuild** ‚Üí Migration can be automated; no need to manually recreate everything.  
- **Azure Migrate** ‚Üí Focused on VMs and servers, not database-level migrations.  

---

### üìñ Official Reference:
[Microsoft Docs: Migrate from Azure Table Storage to Azure Cosmos DB Table API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/table/table-api-migrate)

---

**Summary:** Migrating from Table Storage to Cosmos DB Table API usually just requires changing the connection string and optionally migrating existing data.

---

## Question 3

You are designing an Azure virtual machine (VM) solution.

You need to understand:

- What is a VM Availability Set?  
- What is a VM Scale Set?  
- How they differ, and when to use one over the other.

### ‚ùì Question:
Which best describes VM Availability Sets and VM Scale Sets, their differences, and when to use them?

- ‚ùå **A VM Availability Set automatically adds or removes VMs based on demand, while a VM Scale Set ensures VMs are spread across fault and update domains for availability.**  
- ‚úÖ **A VM Availability Set spreads VMs across fault and update domains for high availability, while a VM Scale Set automatically scales VMs up or down based on demand.**  
- ‚ùå Both VM Availability Sets and VM Scale Sets automatically scale VM instances based on load.  
- ‚ùå A VM Availability Set is used for scaling VMs up and down automatically, while VM Scale Sets are used only for high availability during planned maintenance.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**A VM Availability Set spreads VMs across fault and update domains for high availability, while a VM Scale Set automatically scales VMs up or down based on demand.**

---

### üîç Explanation:

**VM Availability Set:**  
- Distributes VMs across **fault domains** (different physical servers/racks) and **update domains** (different maintenance windows).  
- Provides **high availability** during hardware failures or planned maintenance.  
- **Does not auto-scale** ‚Äî you must manually add/remove VMs.  

**VM Scale Set:**  
- Deploys and manages a group of **identical VMs**.  
- **Automatically scales** the number of VMs up/down based on metrics like CPU usage, memory, or a schedule.  
- Can also ensure high availability by spreading VMs across zones or fault domains.  

---

### üî• When to Use Which

| Situation | Use |
|----------|-----|
| High availability with **manual scaling** | **VM Availability Set** |
| **Auto-scaling** VM instances based on demand | **VM Scale Set** |

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Incorrect:
- **Availability Sets do not auto-scale** ‚Äî they just ensure redundancy.  
- **VM Scale Sets are primarily about scaling**, but can also provide availability.  

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:
- [What is an Azure VM Availability Set?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview)  
- [What is an Azure VM Scale Set?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview)  

---

**Summary:** VM Availability Sets focus on high availability by distributing VMs across fault and update domains, while VM Scale Sets handle automatic scaling of VMs based on demand.

---

# Question 4

You are working with Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), and you want to understand:

- What are the main groups of VM compute configurations that Azure offers?

### ‚ùì Question:
What are some of the main groups of VM compute configurations in Azure?

- ‚ùå Memory-optimized, Storage-optimized, CPU-optimized  
- ‚ùå General purpose, Compute-intensive, Graphics-intensive  
- ‚úÖ **General purpose, Compute-optimized, Memory-optimized, Storage-optimized, GPU-optimized, High Performance Compute (HPC)**  
- ‚ùå CPU-only, Memory-only, Storage-only, GPU-only

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**General purpose, Compute-optimized, Memory-optimized, Storage-optimized, GPU-optimized, High Performance Compute (HPC)**

### üîç Explanation
Azure groups VM families by workload profile:

- **General purpose** ‚Äî balanced CPU-to-memory; good for web servers, small databases, dev/test.  
- **Compute-optimized** ‚Äî high CPU-to-memory; good for compute-heavy tasks like batch processing and medium-traffic web servers.  
- **Memory-optimized** ‚Äî high memory-to-CPU; suited for relational DBs, in-memory caches, analytics.  
- **Storage-optimized** ‚Äî high disk throughput and IOPS; best for big data, NoSQL, large databases.  
- **GPU-optimized** ‚Äî VMs with GPUs for graphics, rendering, and AI/ML training/inference.  
- **High Performance Compute (HPC)** ‚Äî specialized for tightly-coupled, latency-sensitive compute workloads (simulations, scientific compute, large-scale ML).

**When to pick which:** choose the family whose resource profile (CPU, memory, disk I/O, GPU, network/HPC features) matches your workload‚Äôs bottleneck.

---

### ‚ùå Why the other options are wrong
- The first two choices are incomplete or use imprecise labels; Azure provides GPU and HPC families as well.  
- ‚ÄúCPU-only / Memory-only / Storage-only / GPU-only‚Äù is a simplification that doesn‚Äôt reflect Azure‚Äôs official VM family groupings.

---

**Summary:** Azure VM families are grouped by workload needs‚Äîgeneral, compute-, memory-, storage-, GPU-optimized, and HPC‚Äîso pick the family whose resource profile matches your workload‚Äôs primary bottleneck.

---

# Question 5

You are working with Azure Virtual Machine disks, and you need to understand:

- Which disks are managed?  
- Which disks can be unmanaged?  
- What to remember when using unmanaged disks?

### ‚ùì Question:
Which Azure disks are managed, which are unmanaged, and what are important considerations when using unmanaged disks?

- ‚úÖ **Managed disks include Standard HDD, Standard SSD, and Premium SSD. Unmanaged disks are just page blobs stored manually in a storage account. Using unmanaged disks requires you to manage storage accounts and capacity yourself.**  
- ‚ùå Managed disks must be managed manually by users. Unmanaged disks automatically adjust capacity without user intervention.  
- ‚ùå Managed disks and unmanaged disks behave identically in Azure, and there is no difference between them.  
- ‚ùå All Azure disks are unmanaged by default; you must configure managed disks manually if needed.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Managed disks include Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, and Ultra Disk. Unmanaged disks are page blobs in a storage account that you must manage yourself.**

---

### üîç Explanation

**Managed Disks:**  
- Azure handles the **storage account creation**, **scaling**, **availability**, and **IOPS limits** automatically.  
- Types:  
  - ‚úÖ **Standard HDD**  
  - ‚úÖ **Standard SSD**  
  - ‚úÖ **Premium SSD**  
  - ‚úÖ **Ultra Disk**  
- Simplifies management ‚Äî you don't worry about storage account capacity or performance limits.

**Unmanaged Disks:**  
- Implemented as **page blobs** in a user-managed storage account.  
- You must:  
  - Monitor **storage account capacity and IOPS limits**.  
  - Distribute disks across multiple storage accounts if needed to avoid hitting limits.  
  - Ensure availability and redundancy manually.

**Key Considerations for Unmanaged Disks:**  
- Manual operational overhead (storage account quotas, scaling).  
- More prone to hitting performance limits if not carefully planned.  
- Today, **managed disks are the default and recommended option**.

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong
- **"Managed disks must be managed manually"** ‚Üí Opposite of the truth.  
- **"No difference between managed and unmanaged"** ‚Üí There are major differences in responsibility and scalability.  
- **"All disks are unmanaged by default"** ‚Üí Managed disks are the default in the Azure portal since 2017.

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:
- [Managed disks overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview)  
- [Introduction to unmanaged disks](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-unmanaged-disks)

---

**Summary:** Managed disks are the default and offload capacity, scaling, and availability management to Azure, while unmanaged disks require you to manually manage storage accounts and their limits.

---

# Question 6

You are working with Azure Virtual Machines and need to understand:

- How to limit traffic to and from a VM  
- Which common ports are important for security and access  

### ‚ùì Question:
How do you limit traffic to and from a VM in Azure, and what are some important ports to know?

- ‚ùå Use Azure Security Center to encrypt traffic and block all incoming requests automatically  
- ‚úÖ **Use Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to allow or deny traffic based on rules. Common ports to watch include 22, 80, 443, and 3389.**  
- ‚ùå Use Azure Active Directory to apply traffic policies directly to the VM  
- ‚ùå Use Azure Traffic Manager to block unauthorized traffic  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Use Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to allow or deny traffic based on rules. Common ports include 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 3389 (RDP).**

---

### üîç Explanation

**Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs):**  
NSGs are the primary way to control inbound and outbound network traffic to Azure resources, including VMs.  

You can create **rules** that allow or deny traffic based on:  
- **Source/Destination** IP address or subnet  
- **Protocol** (TCP, UDP)  
- **Port number**  
- **Direction** (Inbound or Outbound)

**Important Ports to Watch:**  
- **22** ‚Üí SSH (Linux VM remote access)  
- **3389** ‚Üí RDP (Windows VM remote access)  
- **80** ‚Üí HTTP (unsecured web traffic)  
- **443** ‚Üí HTTPS (secure web traffic)  

**Security Tip:**  
Restrict remote access ports (22, 3389) to trusted IPs whenever possible to reduce attack surface.

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong
- **Azure Security Center** ‚Üí Gives recommendations but doesn‚Äôt directly filter traffic.  
- **Azure Active Directory** ‚Üí Handles authentication/identity, not network filtering.  
- **Azure Traffic Manager** ‚Üí Balances traffic across regions, not used for blocking traffic.  

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:
- [What is a Network Security Group?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview)

---

**Summary:** You control VM traffic with NSGs by creating allow/deny rules, and you should monitor critical ports like 22, 3389, 80, and 443 for security.

---

# Question 7 (Mark for Review)

You are preparing to deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure and need to understand:

- Which Azure resources are required to create a VM with the desired configuration  
- What steps are needed to ensure specific features are enabled on that VM  

### ‚ùì Question:
Which resources are necessary to deploy a VM with the desired configuration, and what are the steps to ensure a VM has a feature enabled?

- ‚ùå You need only a storage account. Install desired features manually after deployment.  
- ‚úÖ **You need a virtual network, a subnet, a public IP address (optional), a network interface card, and a disk. Use extensions or configuration at deployment time to enable features.**  
- ‚ùå You need an Azure Active Directory tenant and a Key Vault. Enable features using RBAC roles.  
- ‚ùå You need an availability set and an NSG. Enable features by scaling the VM manually after deployment.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**You need a virtual network, subnet, (optional) public IP, NIC, and disk. Use VM extensions or configuration during deployment to enable features.**

---

### üîç Explanation

**Resources Required to Deploy a VM:**
- **Virtual Network (VNet)** ‚Üí Required for networking.  
- **Subnet** ‚Üí Logical segment of the VNet where the VM resides.  
- **Network Interface Card (NIC)** ‚Üí Connects the VM to the subnet.  
- **Public IP Address (Optional)** ‚Üí Needed if external internet access is required.  
- **Disks** ‚Üí OS disk is required; optional data disks can be attached.  

**Steps to Ensure Features Are Enabled:**
- **VM Extensions** ‚Üí Install software, enable monitoring, configure management tools at deployment time.  
- **ARM Templates / Bicep** ‚Üí Automate configuration and ensure consistency across environments.  
- **Desired State Configuration (DSC)** ‚Üí Enforce specific settings post-deployment.  

**Best Practice:** Configure features during deployment rather than after ‚Äî ensures consistency, automation, and reduces manual errors.

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong
- **Storage Account only** ‚Üí Not required for modern VMs with managed disks.  
- **Azure AD + Key Vault only** ‚Üí Relevant for identity/secrets, not VM creation.  
- **Availability Set + NSG only** ‚Üí Help with availability and security, but you still need networking and disks to deploy the VM.  

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:
- [Quickstart: Create a VM with Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal)

---

**Summary:** To deploy a VM, you need a VNet, subnet, NIC, (optional) public IP, and disks ‚Äî and you should enable required features at deployment using extensions or ARM templates for automation.

---

# Question 8

You are working with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and need to know:

- What are the main sections that make up an ARM template?  

### ‚ùì Question:
What are the main sections of an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template?

- ‚ùå Schema, Version, Actions, Storage, Compute  
- ‚úÖ **Parameters, Variables, Resources, Outputs**  
- ‚ùå Identity, Networking, Storage, Compute  
- ‚ùå Location, Size, ResourceGroup, Outputs  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Parameters, Variables, Resources, Outputs**

---

### üîç Explanation

**ARM Template Main Sections:**

- **Parameters** ‚Üí Allow passing values into the template at deployment time (e.g., location, VM size).  
- **Variables** ‚Üí Store and reuse calculated values, resource names, or concatenated strings.  
- **Resources** ‚Üí Define which Azure resources to deploy (VMs, VNets, storage accounts, etc.).  
- **Outputs** ‚Üí Return values after deployment (e.g., a public IP address or resource ID).

This structure makes templates reusable, consistent, and flexible.

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong
- **Schema, Version, Actions, Storage, Compute** ‚Üí Not actual sections of ARM templates (Schema and ContentVersion exist but are metadata, not main sections).  
- **Identity, Networking, Storage, Compute** ‚Üí These are resource types, not structural sections.  
- **Location, Size, ResourceGroup, Outputs** ‚Üí These are resource properties or parameters, not top-level sections.

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:
- [ARM Template Structure and Syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-syntax)

---

**Summary:** ARM templates have four main sections ‚Äî **Parameters**, **Variables**, **Resources**, and **Outputs** ‚Äî which allow flexible, repeatable deployments.


---

# Question 9

You are working with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and need to understand:

- How to declare and work with variables in a template  

### ‚ùì Question:
How do you create and work with variables in an ARM template?

- ‚ùå Declare variables inside the resources section and use them only within one resource.  
- ‚úÖ **Declare variables in a dedicated variables section and reference them throughout the template using the `variables()` function.**  
- ‚ùå Declare variables by modifying the parameters section and hard-coding the values.  
- ‚ùå Declare variables inside the outputs section to reuse them later.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Declare variables in the `variables` section and reference them throughout the template with the `variables()` function.**

---

### üîç Explanation

**Variables in ARM Templates:**
- Declared under the top-level **`variables`** section.  
- Reusable anywhere in the template using:  

```jsonc
  "[variables('variableName')]"
```

- Help reduce repetition, simplify maintenance, and make templates cleaner.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "variables": {
    "storageAccountName": "examplestorageacct"
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2022-09-01",
      "location": "eastus",
      "properties": {}
    }
  ]
}

```
  ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong

- Declaring inside resources ‚Üí Not valid; variables must be at the template root level.
- Hard-coding in parameters ‚Üí Removes flexibility and reusability.
- Declaring in outputs ‚Üí Not supported; outputs can use variables but cannot define them.

üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:

- Variables in ARM templates

> Summary: Define variables once in the variables section and reference them anywhere in the template with the variables() function to keep your ARM templates clean and maintainable.

---

# Question 10

You are working with Bicep and need to know:

- How to configure a deployment for a new resource  

### ‚ùì Question:
When working with Bicep, how do you configure a deployment for a new resource?

- ‚ùå Write JSON directly into a Bicep file to define resources.  
- ‚úÖ **Use the `resource` keyword followed by the symbolic name, resource type, and properties.**  
- ‚ùå Use the `deploy` keyword with a list of resources.  
- ‚ùå Import an ARM template into the Bicep file without modifications.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Use the `resource` keyword followed by the symbolic name, resource type, and properties.**

---

### üîç Explanation

In **Bicep**, resources are declared with the `resource` keyword.  

You specify:  
- **Symbolic name** ‚Üí Local name you use inside the file  
- **Resource type and API version** ‚Üí e.g., `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01`  
- **Configuration properties** ‚Üí Name, location, SKU, and other settings  

**Example:**
```bicep
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01' = {
  name: 'examplestorageacct'
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  properties: {}
}
```

This syntax is much cleaner and easier to read than ARM JSON templates.

‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong

- Write JSON directly ‚Üí Bicep is an abstraction over JSON, not a place to embed raw JSON.
- Use deploy keyword ‚Üí There is no such keyword in Bicep.
- Import ARM template ‚Üí Possible to decompile ARM templates into Bicep, but not how you define new resources.

üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:

- Bicep Language - Declare Resources

> Summary: In Bicep, you use the resource keyword with a symbolic name, type, and properties to configure and deploy new resources.

----

# Question 11

You are working with ARM templates or Bicep and need to know:

- How to use variables effectively during deployments  

### ‚ùì Question:
How do you use variables when working with Azure Bicep or ARM templates?  
(Select one answer.)

- ‚ùå Declare variables inside the outputs section and reference them during resource creation.  
- ‚ùå Declare variables inside the resources section and hard-code them per resource.  
- ‚úÖ **Declare variables in a `variables` block and use the `variables('variableName')` function in ARM templates or simply use `variableName` in Bicep.**  
- ‚ùå Declare variables dynamically by modifying the schema section during deployment.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Declare variables in a `variables` block and use the `variables('variableName')` function in ARM templates or simply use `variableName` in Bicep.**

---

### üîç Explanation

Variables are used to simplify templates, reduce duplication, and make them easier to maintain.  

- **In ARM Templates (JSON)**  
  - Defined in a `variables` section  
  - Referenced with the `variables('variableName')` function  

**Example (ARM JSON):**
```jsonc
{
  "variables": {
    "storageAccountName": "examplestorageacct"
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2022-09-01",
      "location": "eastus",
      "properties": {}
    }
  ]
}
```
In Bicep

- Defined using the var keyword
- Referenced directly by name (no function needed)

Example (Bicep):

```bicep
var storageAccountName = 'examplestorageacct'

resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01' = {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: 'eastus'
  properties: {}
}
```
‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong

- Inside outputs section ‚Üí You can reference variables in outputs, but you cannot declare variables there.
- Inside resources section ‚Üí Variables must be declared globally, not within individual resources.
- Modifying schema section ‚Üí Schema is for template metadata, not for defining variables.

üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:

- Variables in ARM Templates
- Variables in Bicep

> Summary:
In ARM templates, use variables('name'); in Bicep, use var name = value and reference it directly.

---

# Question 12

You are working with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and need to understand:

- The difference between **incremental** and **complete** template deployments  

### ‚ùì Question:
What is the difference between an incremental and a complete template deployment?

- ‚ùå Incremental deployment deletes all resources in the resource group not in the template; complete deployment only adds resources.  
- ‚úÖ **Incremental deployment only updates or adds resources defined in the template; complete deployment deletes resources not present in the template.**  
- ‚ùå Incremental deployment always deploys resources twice for high availability; complete deployment deploys once.  
- ‚ùå Incremental deployment automatically scales resources, while complete deployment locks them after creation.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Incremental deployment only updates or adds resources defined in the template; complete deployment deletes resources not present in the template.**

---

### üîç Explanation

**Incremental Deployment:**  
- Adds new resources and updates existing resources **listed in the template**.  
- Leaves other existing resources in the resource group untouched.  
- Safer for ongoing deployments where you don‚Äôt want to remove resources accidentally.

**Complete Deployment:**  
- Deletes any resource in the resource group that is **not defined in the template**.  
- Ensures the resource group matches the template exactly.  
- Useful for ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù deployments but can remove unintended resources if not careful.

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong
- **Deleting all resources in incremental** ‚Üí Incorrect; incremental leaves unmentioned resources intact.  
- **Deploying twice for high availability** ‚Üí Deployment happens once unless explicitly retried.  
- **Scaling and locking automatically** ‚Üí Not related to deployment modes.

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:
- [Deployment modes - Incremental and Complete](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-modes)

---

**Summary:** Incremental deployments add or update resources without removing others, while complete deployments remove resources not defined in the template to match it exactly.

---

# Question 13

You are working with Azure App Services and need to understand:

- The relationship between **App Service Plans** and **App Services**  

### ‚ùì Question:
What is the relationship between App Service Plans and App Services in Azure?

- ‚úÖ **An App Service Plan defines the infrastructure and features (such as pricing and scaling), while App Services (like web apps, APIs) run inside the App Service Plan.**  
- ‚ùå An App Service Plan is the application code, and App Services provide storage for the code.  
- ‚ùå App Services manage the billing and networking; App Service Plans handle user authentication.  
- ‚ùå App Service Plans and App Services are completely independent; they don't affect each other.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**An App Service Plan defines the infrastructure and features, and App Services run inside it.**

---

### üîç Explanation

**App Service Plan:**  
- Determines the **compute resources** (CPU, memory, storage) available to apps.  
- Defines the **pricing tier** (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium).  
- Manages **scaling options**, including manual and auto-scaling.  

**App Services:**  
- Include **Web Apps, API Apps, Mobile Apps, and Function Apps**.  
- Are the actual applications you deploy and run.  
- Can share the same App Service Plan to save costs if resource demands are moderate.

**Key Relationship:**  
- An App Service **cannot exist without an App Service Plan**.  
- Multiple App Services can share one plan, but the plan controls their resources, pricing, and scaling.

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong
- **App Service Plan is application code** ‚Üí Incorrect; it‚Äôs infrastructure, not code.  
- **App Services handle billing and networking** ‚Üí Billing is tied to the App Service Plan, not the app itself.  
- **Completely independent** ‚Üí False; App Services rely on a plan to run.

---

### üìñ Official Microsoft Reference:
- [What is an Azure App Service Plan?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans)

---

**Summary:** App Service Plans provide the compute, scaling, and pricing for your apps, while App Services are the applications that run inside these plans.

---

# Question 14

You are working with Azure App Services and need to know:

- Whether an App Service can be associated with more than one App Service Plan  

### ‚ùì Question:
Can an Azure App Service be associated with more than one App Service Plan?

- ‚ùå Yes, an App Service can belong to multiple App Service Plans at the same time.  
- ‚úÖ **No, an App Service can belong to only one App Service Plan at a time.**  
- ‚ùå Yes, but only if the App Service is duplicated manually across regions.  
- ‚ùå No, App Service Plans and App Services are unrelated to each other.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**No, an App Service can belong to only one App Service Plan at a time.**

---

### üîç Explanation

- Each **Azure App Service** is linked to a single **App Service Plan**.  
- The **App Service Plan** provides compute resources, scaling, and pricing for the App Service.  
- To use a different plan, you must **migrate the App Service** to another plan manually, ensuring it is in the same **resource group and region**.  
- While multiple App Services can share a plan, **a single App Service cannot span multiple plans**.

---

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong
- **Multiple plans at once** ‚Üí Not supported; only one plan per App Service.

- **Container Runtime Requirement:**  
  - Azure requires a container runtime to **pull, run, and manage containers**.  
  - Common runtimes:  
    - **Docker**  
    - **containerd** (lightweight runtime often used under the hood)

- **Azure App Service:**  
  - If you select **Docker Container** during creation, the platform handles the runtime for you.  

- **Other Azure Services:**  
  - **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** and **ACI (Azure Container Instances)** run containers via Docker or containerd directly.

- **Other Options Explained:**  
  - **Windows runtime** ‚Üí Needs a container runtime installed to run containers.  
  - **Linux runtime** ‚Üí Common for containers, but still requires Docker/containerd.  
  - **AKS runtime** ‚Üí AKS itself orchestrates containers but relies on Docker/containerd internally.

- ‚ùå Yes, you can change environment variables instantly without restarting or redeploying anything.  
- ‚ùå No, unless you delete the entire cluster or app environment.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**Yes, you can edit the deployment configuration (or app revision), but the container must restart for changes to take effect.**

---

### üîç Explanation

**In Kubernetes (AKS):**  
- Environment variables are set in the **Deployment YAML** or Helm chart.  
- To update:  
  1. Modify the YAML configuration with the new environment variables.  
  2. Apply the changes using `kubectl apply -f <deployment.yaml>`.  
- Kubernetes **recreates the pods**, so containers restart to pick up new variables.

**In Azure Container Apps:**  
- Modify **revisions or configuration settings**.  
- Changing environment variables triggers Azure to create a **new app revision** automatically.  
- The app restarts seamlessly with the new configuration applied.

**Key Point:**  
- Both services require a **container restart or pod recreation** to apply environment variable changes.  
- Unlike App Service, you cannot update variables live in a running container without a restart.

---

### ‚ùå Other Options Explained
- **Locked after deployment** ‚Üí Wrong; variables can be updated, but restart is required.  
- **Instant without restart** ‚Üí Not possible; environment variables are injected at startup.

- ‚ùå The secret is locked by a firewall rule.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answers:
- **The secret is disabled**  
- **The secret has expired**

---

### üîç Explanation:

A secret in Azure Key Vault may exist but be unusable in the following cases:

1. **Disabled secret:**  
   - When a secret's `enabled` property is set to `false`, it remains stored in the Key Vault but cannot be used until re-enabled.

2. **Expired secret:**  
   - If a secret has an expiration date (`exp`) and the date has passed, the secret cannot be used, even though it physically exists in the vault.

Other options explained:

- **Deleted but not purged** ‚Üí The secret is in a deleted state and no longer active.  
- **Different region** ‚Üí The secret's usability is not affected by region; it‚Äôs tied to its Key Vault.  
- **Firewall lock** ‚Üí Access might be blocked, but the secret itself is still active in the vault.

---

### **Summary:**  
A secret can exist in Azure Key Vault but be unusable if it is **disabled** or **expired**, even though it physically remains in the vault.

# Question 48

Can you get fine-grained access level control to individual secrets in Azure Key Vault?

- ‚ùå Yes, by assigning specific permissions at the individual secret level.  
- ‚úÖ No, access policies apply only at the entire Key Vault level.  
- ‚ùå Yes, by creating separate Key Vaults for each secret.  
- ‚ùå No, you must use Azure Storage instead of Key Vault for fine-grained access.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**No, access policies apply only at the entire Key Vault level.**

---

### üîç Explanation:

- Azure Key Vault **access policies** or **RBAC permissions** apply at the **vault level**, not the individual secret level.  
- Granting a user access to read secrets allows them to read **all secrets** in that Key Vault.  
- To achieve more isolated access (e.g., a user can access only one secret), you must create **separate Key Vaults** for each secret and manage access individually.  
- Fine-grained, per-secret control **is not natively supported** within a single Key Vault.

---

### **Summary:**  
Access control in Azure Key Vault is **vault-wide**, and individual secrets cannot have separate access policies.

# Question 52

How does a CDN work in relation to user requests, serving data, and Time-To-Live (TTL)?

- ‚ùå When a user makes a request, the CDN always contacts the original server to fetch the latest data.  
- ‚úÖ When a user makes a request, the CDN first checks its cache; if the content is cached and valid based on TTL, it serves the content directly without contacting the origin server.  
- ‚ùå The CDN replicates the full database and performs dynamic authentication before serving content.  
- ‚ùå The CDN encrypts the request and forwards it to Azure Active Directory before responding.  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:
**When a user makes a request, the CDN first checks its cache; if the content is cached and valid based on TTL, it serves the content directly without contacting the origin server.**

---

### üîç Explanation:

- **CDN Request Flow:**  
  1. User requests content.  
  2. CDN edge server checks its cache.  
  3. If cached content is still valid (based on TTL):  
     - Served directly from the edge (fast, no origin call).  
  4. If not cached or expired:  
     - CDN fetches from origin server, caches it, then serves to the user.  

- **TTL (Time-To-Live):**  
  - Defines how long content stays cached.  
  - After TTL expires, CDN will re-fetch from origin on the next request.  

- **Benefits:**  
  - Reduced latency  
  - Lower origin server load  
  - Faster user experience  

---

### **Summary:**  
A CDN **serves cached content from edge servers if it is still valid (based on TTL)**, otherwise it fetches fresh content from the origin, caches it, and then serves it to the user.
