# ORMs Folder Overview
This folder contains resources on **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** tools. ORMs allow you to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, reducing the need to write raw SQL queries.

## Examples of ORMs
* **Entity Framework / EF Core**: An ORM for **.NET** applications, enabling developers to work with databases using .NET objects. **EF Core** is the modern, cross-platform version.
* **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM for **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, known for its powerful type-safety and auto-generated database client.
* **Hibernate**: A popular ORM framework for **Java**, widely used in enterprise applications for mapping Java objects to relational database tables.
* **Sequelize**: A promise-based ORM for **Node.js**, supporting multiple dialects such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
