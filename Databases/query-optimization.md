# Optimizing Queries

# Best Practices for Query Performance in Databases

Query performance directly impacts application speed, scalability, and user experience. Poorly optimized queries can lead to high CPU usage, memory pressure, long response times, and increased costs â€” especially in production environments.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Queries Get Slow

* **Missing indexes** â†’ Full table or collection scans.
* **Poor schema design** â†’ Unnecessary joins or deep nesting.
* **Large payloads** â†’ Returning more data than needed.
* **Unoptimized filters** â†’ Non-sargable conditions (e.g., functions in `WHERE`).
* **Hot partitions** (Cosmos DB, MongoDB, sharded DBs).
* **Concurrency & locking** â†’ Multiple queries blocking each other.
* **Outdated statistics** (SQL databases).

## ðŸ”¹ General Optimization Strategies

1. **Use Indexes Wisely**
   * Add indexes on frequently filtered or sorted fields.
   * Avoid over-indexing â€” slows down writes.

2. **Limit Data Retrieval**
   * Use `SELECT` specific fields instead of `SELECT *`.
   * Use `.project()` (MongoDB) or projection queries (Cosmos DB).

3. **Optimize Filters**
   * Make filters index-friendly.
   * Avoid applying functions on indexed columns (e.g., `LOWER(name)`).

4. **Use Pagination**
   * Apply `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` or cursor-based pagination.
   * Prevent loading thousands of records at once.

5. **Analyze Query Plans**
   * SQL â†’ `EXPLAIN` or `SET STATISTICS IO/TIME`.
   * MongoDB â†’ `.explain("executionStats")`.
   * Cosmos DB â†’ Query metrics in Azure Portal.

6. **Pre-compute When Needed**
   * Use materialized views, caching layers, or denormalization.

## ðŸ”¹ If Queries Are Slow in Production

1. **Monitor & Profile**
   * Enable query logging or use built-in profilers.
   * Track long-running queries with monitoring tools.

2. **Check Index Usage**
   * Validate queries are using indexes (execution plans).
   * Add or adjust indexes in hot paths.

3. **Optimize Schema**
   * For document DBs (MongoDB, Cosmos DB), denormalize data if joins are costly.
   * For relational DBs, normalize where redundant data causes bloat.

4. **Partition & Shard**
   * Ensure even distribution of data.
   * Reconsider partition keys if hot partitions exist.

5. **Leverage Caching**
   * Use Redis or in-memory cache for frequently accessed data.
   * Cache query results where possible.

6. **Scale Appropriately**
   * Relational DBs â†’ Scale vertically (compute/memory) or read replicas.
   * Cosmos DB â†’ Increase RU/s or switch to autoscale.
   * MongoDB â†’ Add shards for horizontal scaling.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools for Query Optimization

* **SQL**
  * `EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`, Query Store (SQL Server), Index Advisor.
* **MongoDB**
  * `db.collection.explain("executionStats")`.
  * Atlas Performance Advisor.
* **Cosmos DB**
  * Query Metrics in Azure Portal.
  * Partition key analysis tool.
* **Application**
  * APM tools like New Relic, Datadog, Application Insights.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

Optimizing queries requires a mix of **good schema design, smart indexing, and runtime monitoring**.  
In development â†’ focus on schema design and indexing.  
In production â†’ monitor, analyze query plans, and use caching or scaling as needed.  

By following these practices, teams can reduce latency, improve throughput, and control costs.
