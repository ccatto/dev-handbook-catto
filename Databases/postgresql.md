# Postgresql | Catto Dev Handbook

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for reliability, feature richness, and standards compliance. It is widely used with C# Web APIs and Angular front ends.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

* Open-source object-relational database system.
* ACID-compliant and transactional. (guarantees the reliability and integrity of our data)
* Supports advanced data types (JSON, arrays, XML, hstore).
* Extensible: functions, stored procedures, triggers, custom data types.
* Highly compatible with **ORMs** like Entity Framework Core, TypeORM, Sequelize, and Prisma.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Uses

* Backend databases for **web applications** (REST/GraphQL APIs).
* Enterprise-grade applications needing **data integrity** and **complex queries**.
* Analytics and reporting.
* Geo-spatial applications via PostGIS extension.
* JSON/Document storage for hybrid relational-document use cases.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Architectural Patterns / Best Practices

* **Schemas** â†’ Organize tables and objects logically.
* **Normalization** â†’ Reduces redundancy; improve data integrity.
* **Indexes** â†’ Improve query performance; use B-tree, GIN, GiST indexes.
* **Transactions** â†’ Group multiple operations atomically.
* **Views & Materialized Views** â†’ Simplify complex queries and improve performance.
* **Stored Procedures / Functions** â†’ Encapsulate business logic in DB layer.
* **Connection Pooling** â†’ Use pooled connections for scalable API usage.
* **ORM Integration** â†’ Use EF Core, Dapper, Prisma, or TypeORM for C# or Node.js backends.

## ðŸ”¹ Common Folder / Connection Structure in C# Web API

```
/MyWebApi
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Data
â”‚   â””â”€ AppDbContext.cs         # Entity Framework Core DbContext
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Repositories
â”‚   â””â”€ UserRepository.cs
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Services
â”‚   â””â”€ UserService.cs
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Controllers
â”‚   â””â”€ UserController.cs
```

* **DbContext** â†’ Manages PostgreSQL connection.
* **Repositories** â†’ CRUD operations.
* **Services** â†’ Business logic.
* **Controllers** â†’ HTTP request handling.

---

### Code Flow

* Client sends HTTP request.
* Controller forwards to Service layer.
* Service handles business logic.
* Repository/DbContext interacts with PostgreSQL.
* Data returns through the same path to the client.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why It's Popular

* **Open Source & Free** â†’ No licensing costs.
* **Standards Compliant** â†’ SQL compliance and ACID transactions.
* **Extensible** â†’ Functions, triggers, JSON support.
* **Scalable & Reliable** â†’ MVCC architecture for concurrent transactions.
* **Ecosystem** â†’ Large community, libraries, and cloud support.
* **Integration** â†’ Works well with .NET, Node.js, Python, and more.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Additional Helpful Sections

* **Replication & High Availability** â†’ Streaming replication, failover.
* **Backup & Restore** â†’ pg\_dump, WAL archiving.
* **Monitoring & Performance** â†’ pg\_stat\_activity, EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
* **Security** â†’ Roles, schemas, row-level security.
* **Extensions** â†’ PostGIS, UUID-OSSP, Full-Text Search.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

PostgreSQL is a robust, feature-rich relational database suitable for modern web applications. It integrates well with C# Web APIs and Angular front ends, supports complex queries and transactions, and is highly extensible. Its popularity stems from performance, reliability, open-source nature, and strong ecosystem support.
