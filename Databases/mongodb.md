# MongoDB Overview for Databases

**MongoDB** is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database designed for scalability, flexibility, and performance. Unlike relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in **JSON-like documents (BSON)**, making it ideal for applications with rapidly evolving data models.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

* **Schema-less** â†’ Collections of documents without rigid schema.
* **BSON format** â†’ Binary JSON with support for additional data types.
* **Horizontally scalable** â†’ Sharding distributes data across multiple servers.
* **Replication** â†’ Provides high availability through replica sets.
* **Rich querying** â†’ Filter, aggregate, and index data with powerful operators.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Uses

* **Web applications** that require flexible schema (e.g., user profiles, content management).
* **Real-time analytics** with large-scale data.
* **IoT applications** handling high-volume device data.
* **Catalogs, product inventory, and e-commerce systems**.
* **Mobile apps** using **MongoDB Realm** for offline sync.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts

* **Database** â†’ Contains multiple collections.
* **Collection** â†’ Groups of BSON documents (similar to tables in SQL).
* **Document** â†’ JSON-like data structure (key-value pairs).
* **Replica Set** â†’ Group of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data for fault tolerance.
* **Sharding** â†’ Partitioning data across servers to scale horizontally.
* **Indexes** â†’ Improve query performance.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Architectural Patterns

* **Schema Design**
  * Embed data for performance (e.g., user with embedded addresses).
  * Reference data for normalization (e.g., user and posts).
* **Sharding & Replication**
  * Sharding â†’ Scale horizontally.
  * Replica sets â†’ Ensure high availability.
* **Aggregation Pipeline**
  * Transform and analyze data (similar to SQL GROUP BY, JOIN, etc.).

## ðŸ”¹ Best Practices for Folder Structure (Node.js + MongoDB)
```graphql
/src
â”‚ app.ts
â”‚ database.ts # MongoDB connection
â”‚
â”œâ”€ models
â”‚ â””â”€ user.model.ts # Mongoose schemas or custom MongoDB classes
â”‚
â”œâ”€ repositories
â”‚ â””â”€ user.repository.ts
â”‚
â”œâ”€ services
â”‚ â””â”€ user.service.ts
â”‚
â””â”€ controllers
â””â”€ user.controller.ts
```

* **Models** â†’ Define document structure (using Mongoose or schema validation).
* **Repositories** â†’ Data access methods (find, insert, update).
* **Services** â†’ Business logic.
* **Controllers** â†’ Handle API requests and responses.

* Client sends request (HTTP or GraphQL).
* Controller validates and routes request.
* Service applies business logic.
* Repository interacts with MongoDB.
* Response returns to client.

## ðŸ”¹ Why It's Popular

* **Flexible schema** â†’ Adapts quickly to changing requirements.
* **JSON-like storage** â†’ Natural fit for JavaScript/TypeScript apps.
* **High scalability** â†’ Sharding and replication built-in.
* **Powerful aggregation** â†’ Advanced queries without complex joins.
* **Cloud-native support** â†’ MongoDB Atlas for managed hosting.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Additional Helpful Sections

* **Security**
  * Enable authentication and role-based access.
  * Use TLS/SSL for encrypted connections.
* **Performance**
  * Use indexes for frequent queries.
  * Monitor slow queries with `profiler`.
* **Backups**
  * Use `mongodump` / `mongorestore` or Atlas backups.
* **Testing**
  * Use in-memory MongoDB (`mongodb-memory-server`) for integration tests.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

MongoDB is a flexible, scalable NoSQL database that excels in applications requiring rapidly changing data models, real-time analytics, and high availability. With strong developer tooling, cloud integration, and JSON-like data handling, MongoDB has become one of the most widely used modern databases.
