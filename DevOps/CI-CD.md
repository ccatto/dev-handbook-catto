# CI/CD - Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery

# CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) Overview

**CI/CD** is a set of practices and tools that enable development teams to deliver code changes more frequently, reliably, and efficiently. It is fundamental to modern DevOps workflows.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

* **Continuous Integration (CI)** â†’ Developers merge code changes frequently into a shared repository, triggering automated builds and tests.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD)** â†’ Automated deployment of applications to staging or production environments.
* Together, CI/CD ensures that code changes are tested, validated, and deployed quickly with minimal human intervention.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Uses

* Automate testing and validation of new code.
* Reduce integration issues by merging code regularly.
* Deploy applications automatically to staging or production.
* Enable rapid release cycles for web applications, APIs, and microservices.
* Improve software quality and reliability.

---

## ðŸ”¹ CI/CD Workflow / Patterns

1. **Code Commit** â†’ Developer pushes code to the repository.
2. **Build** â†’ Automated build process compiles the code.
3. **Automated Testing** â†’ Unit tests, integration tests, and static analysis run.
4. **Artifact Creation** â†’ Build artifacts or container images are generated.
5. **Deployment** â†’ Code is deployed to staging or production environments.
6. **Monitoring & Feedback** â†’ Application health and performance are monitored; feedback is sent to developers.

**Common Patterns:**

* **Pipeline as Code** â†’ CI/CD pipeline defined in code (e.g., YAML files).
* **GitOps** â†’ Repository-driven deployment and environment management.
* **Blue-Green Deployments** â†’ Minimize downtime and risk.
* **Canary Releases** â†’ Deploy updates to a small subset of users before full release.

## ðŸ”¹ Folder / Pipeline Structure Example

```
/.github/workflows          # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
|   build.yml
|   deploy.yml

/.gitlab-ci.yml             # GitLab CI/CD configuration

/jenkins                    # Jenkins pipeline scripts
|   Jenkinsfile

/src                        # Source code
/tests                      # Unit and integration tests
/docker                     # Docker files for containerization
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Simple Pipeline Example (GitHub Actions YAML)

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          echo "Deploying application..."
          # Add deployment commands here
```

## ðŸ”¹ Code Flow Diagram

```
[ Developer Commit ]
        |
        v
[ CI Pipeline ]
   Build -> Test -> Lint -> Package
        |
        v
[ Artifact / Container Image ]
        |
        v
[ CD Pipeline ]
   Deploy -> Monitor -> Feedback
        |
        v
[ Production / Staging Environment ]
```

## ðŸ”¹ Why It's Popular

* **Faster release cycles** â†’ Automates build, test, and deployment.
* **Improved quality** â†’ Automated testing reduces bugs.
* **Early detection of errors** â†’ Issues are caught in CI before reaching production.
* **Consistent deployments** â†’ Automated CD pipelines reduce human error.
* **Scalable and repeatable** â†’ Works with microservices and multi-environment deployments.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Tools

* **CI/CD Platforms** â†’ GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, CircleCI.
* **Containerization** â†’ Docker, Kubernetes.
* **Monitoring & Observability** â†’ Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.
* **Code Quality & Testing** â†’ SonarQube, Jest, NUnit, PyTest.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Additional Best Practices

* Maintain **pipeline as code** for reproducibility.
* Implement **branching strategies** (GitFlow, trunk-based development).
* Use **feature flags** for safe deployment.
* Integrate **security scans** in CI/CD pipeline (SAST/DAST).
* Enable **rollback strategies** to recover from failures quickly.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

CI/CD is essential for modern software development, enabling fast, reliable, and automated build, test, and deployment workflows. It improves code quality, reduces deployment risk, and supports rapid iteration, making it a cornerstone of DevOps practices.
