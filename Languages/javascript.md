# JavaScript - Catto Developer Handbook

**JavaScript (JS)** is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that powers **web development**, enabling dynamic behavior on websites, server-side development, and even mobile and desktop applications.  

It is one of the **most widely used programming languages** in the world and forms the foundation for modern frameworks like **React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, and Next.js**.

---

## Why JavaScript is Important

- Runs **natively in web browsers**, providing interactive web experiences.  
- Core language for **frontend development**, powering frameworks and libraries.  
- Enables **full-stack development** via Node.js on the backend.  
- Supports **event-driven, asynchronous programming** for scalable apps.  
- Integral to **modern web tooling**, build systems, and testing frameworks.  

---

## Brief History

- Created in **1995** by Brendan Eich at Netscape.  
- Originally called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript**.  
- Standardized as **ECMAScript (ES)** to ensure cross-browser compatibility.  
- Evolved from simple client-side scripts to a **full-featured language** powering web apps, server-side APIs, and desktop apps.

## JavaScript Versions (ECMAScript Highlights)

| Version | Year | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **ES5** | 2009 | Strict mode, JSON support, array methods (map, filter, reduce) |
| **ES6 / ES2015** | 2015 | let/const, arrow functions, classes, template literals, modules |
| **ES7 / ES2016** | 2016 | Exponentiation operator, Array.includes() |
| **ES8 / ES2017** | 2017 | Async/await, Object.entries/values, string padding |
| **ES9 / ES2018** | 2018 | Rest/spread for objects, asynchronous iteration |
| **ES10 / ES2019** | 2019 | Array.flat/flatMap, Object.fromEntries |
| **ES11 / ES2020** | 2020 | Nullish coalescing, optional chaining, BigInt |
| **ES12 / ES2021** | 2021 | Logical assignment operators, Promise.any, WeakRefs |
| **ES13 / ES2022** | 2022 | Top-level await, class fields, ergonomic brand checks |

> Note: Browsers and Node.js versions determine which features are natively supported.

## Key Features of JavaScript

- **Dynamic and loosely typed** language.  
- **First-class functions** and closures for functional programming.  
- **Event-driven programming** for interactive web apps.  
- **Asynchronous programming** via callbacks, promises, and async/await.  
- **Object-oriented programming** with prototypes and ES6 classes.  
- **Modules** for code organization and reuse.  
- **Interoperability** with HTML, CSS, and JSON.  
- **Rich ecosystem** with npm packages and libraries.  

---

## Common Use Cases

- Frontend development with **React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte**.  
- Backend APIs with **Node.js and Express/NestJS**.  
- Automation scripts, CLI tools, and build processes.  
- Mobile app development via **React Native**.  
- Desktop apps via **Electron**.
