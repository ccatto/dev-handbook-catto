# Python - Developer Handbook

**Python** is a **high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language** known for its **readability, simplicity, and versatility**.  

It is widely used in **web development, data science, automation, AI/ML, DevOps, and scripting**, making it one of the most popular languages across industries.

out of the main "Languages" I would say Python is my least frequently used since I grew up on .NET with C# and Javascript; given that I think it is the most popular and most used language currently and has been for a while

## Why Python is Important

- Easy to **learn and read**, reducing development time.  
- Extensive **standard library** and rich ecosystem of packages via **PyPI**.  
- Supports multiple programming paradigms: **procedural, object-oriented, and functional**.  
- Widely used in **backend development**, **data analytics**, **machine learning**, and **automation**.  
- Strong community support and cross-platform compatibility.

## Brief History

- Created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.  
- Designed to emphasize **code readability and simplicity**.  
- Major milestones:
  - **Python 2.x** – Legacy version, widely used until 2020.  
  - **Python 3.x** – Current standard, introduced better Unicode support, new syntax features, and performance improvements.  
- Python is continually updated with new features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements.

## Python Versions (Highlights)

| Version | Year | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Python 2.7** | 2010 | Legacy support, widely adopted before 2020 |
| **Python 3.5** | 2015 | async/await syntax, type hints introduced |
| **Python 3.6** | 2016 | f-strings, underscores in numeric literals |
| **Python 3.7** | 2018 | Data classes, postponed evaluation of type annotations |
| **Python 3.8** | 2019 | Walrus operator (`:=`), positional-only parameters |
| **Python 3.9** | 2020 | Dictionary merge operators (`|`), type hint improvements |
| **Python 3.10** | 2021 | Structural pattern matching (`match`), precise types |
| **Python 3.11** | 2022 | Performance improvements (~10-60% faster), exception groups |
| **Python 3.12** | 2023 | Latest enhancements, standard library improvements |

> Note: Use **Python 3.x** for all modern development; Python 2.x is officially end-of-life.
