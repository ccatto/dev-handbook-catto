# C# - Catto Developer Handbook

**C# (C-Sharp)** is a **modern, object-oriented programming language** developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET ecosystem. It is designed for building **robust, scalable, and high-performance applications** on Windows, web, mobile, cloud, and cross-platform environments.

---

## Why C# is Important

- **Primary language for .NET development**: Web APIs, desktop apps, and cloud services.  
- **Strongly-typed and object-oriented**, reducing runtime errors.  
- Rich tooling with **Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Rider**.  
- Supports **cross-platform development** via .NET Core / .NET 5+.  
- Integral to **enterprise software, cloud solutions, and game development** (Unity).  

---

## Brief History

- Developed by **Anders Hejlsberg** and first released in **2000**.  
- Created as a **modern alternative to C++ and Java** for the Microsoft ecosystem.  
- Evolved with **.NET Framework → .NET Core → .NET 5/6/7+**, becoming fully cross-platform.

## Key Features of C#

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism.  
- **Type safety**: Strong static typing reduces runtime errors.  
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Query collections and databases directly in C#.  
- **Async programming**: Async/await for scalable I/O operations.  
- **Cross-platform** with .NET Core / .NET 5+.  
- **Rich ecosystem**: .NET libraries, NuGet packages, and cloud integration.  
- **Interoperability**: Call C/C++ libraries, COM objects, and REST APIs.  
- **Modern language features**: Pattern matching, tuples, records, nullable reference types.

## Common Use Cases

- **Backend Web APIs**: ASP.NET Core for RESTful services.  
- **Desktop Applications**: Windows Forms, WPF, MAUI.  
- **Cloud Applications**: Azure Functions, microservices.  
- **Game Development**: Unity engine using C#.  
- **Automation & Scripting**: PowerShell integrations, tooling scripts.
