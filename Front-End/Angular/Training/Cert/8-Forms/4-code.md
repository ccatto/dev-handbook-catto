# 🎯 Add Filters to our Movies App

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, we want to **add filters** to the UI so users can search for specific movies by **title** and **year of release**. 🔍

---

## Requirements ✅
- Capture user input in the form using tools discussed in the lesson.  
  💡 **HINT:** Is this a complex form or a simple one? Use the easiest approach to get form values! ✏️  

- Use the `filterMovieList` method from `movies.service` to get an **Observable** of filtered movies based on user input.  

- Display the filtered list of movies to the user. 🎬

---

## Other Considerations ⚠️
- Do **not** remove any `data-test` attributes in the boilerplate.

---

## Example of Finished Application 🎉
The app should dynamically show the list of movies that match the user's search criteria, providing a smooth **filtering experience**.

---

## Summary 📝
By completing this challenge, you learn how to:  
- Capture user input from forms in Angular  
- Use **Observables** to filter and display data reactively  
- Dynamically update the UI based on user input 🔄
