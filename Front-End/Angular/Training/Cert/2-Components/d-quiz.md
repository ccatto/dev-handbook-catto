> 📝 ng-container in Angular

`ng-container` is a **logical container** that doesn’t render any DOM element but can host structural directives like `*ngIf` or `*ngFor`.  

- Allows **multiple structural directives** on what would otherwise be a single element.  
- Can **host ng-templates** and act as a dynamic placeholder for projected content. ✨

**Example:**

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="user.isLoggedIn" *ngFor="let item of items">
  <div>{{ item.name }}</div>
</ng-container>
```

> 🚨 Angular Structural Directive Issue

The following code **does not compile** because Angular **does not allow two structural directives** on the same element:

```html
<div *ngIf="showItems" *ngFor="let item of items">{{item}}</div>
```

✅ Correct Alternative Syntax

To achieve the same DOM structure, use an <ng-container> to host one directive and wrap the other inside it:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="showItems">
  <div *ngFor="let item of items">{{item}}</div>
</ng-container>
```

Explanation

* ng-container is invisible in the DOM but allows applying a structural directive (*ngIf) without creating an extra element.
* The inner <div> handles the *ngFor iteration.
* This produces the exact same DOM output as intended, but compiles correctly. 🎯

Summary: Use <ng-container> to combine multiple structural directives without extra DOM elements. 🚀

# 🔍 Angular ViewChild Example

**Question:**  
What is the purpose of the `ViewChild` decorator in this component?

```ts
@Component({
  ...
  template: '<p #test></p>'
})
export class UserDetailsComponent {
  @ViewChild('test') test;
}
```
Answer: ✅
It provides access from within the component class to the ElementRef object for the <p> tag that has the #test template reference variable. ✨

Explanation

* @ViewChild allows the component class to directly interact with a DOM element or child component.
* You can read properties, call methods, or manipulate the element from your TypeScript code.
* It does not affect rendering or content projection; the <p> will render regardless of @ViewChild. 💡

Summary: Use @ViewChild to get a programmatic handle on an element inside your component template. 🚀

> 🔍 Angular Signals API Question

**Question:**  
Which of the following functions is **not** a part of the Signals API?

- `signal()`  
- `computed()`  
- `effect()`  
- `observable()`  

**Answer:** ❌  
`observable()`  

### Explanation
- `signal()`, `computed()`, and `effect()` are core functions of Angular Signals. ⚡  
- `observable()` is **not part of the Signals API**; Observables come from **RxJs**, not Angular Signals.  

> Summary: Signals use `signal()`, `computed()`, and `effect()` for reactive state, while `observable()` belongs to RxJs. 🚀
