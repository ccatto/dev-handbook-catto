# Environment Setup

Mac

Gotta add all my environment setup stuff here but adding this note here too about dock

* Restart Doc
When Cmd+Tab stops showing apps and the Dock/taskbar (what macOS calls the Dock) is not showing correctly or stays hidden when mouse goes all the way down; 
```bash
killall Dock
```
